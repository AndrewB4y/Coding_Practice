    "Data pipelines allow you to string together code to process large datasets or streams of data without maxing out your machine’s memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate how to build pipelines with generators, you’re going to analyze this file to get the total and average of all series A rounds in the dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "Read every line of the file.\n",
    "Split each line into a list of values.\n",
    "Extract the column names.\n",
    "Use the column names and lists to create a dictionary.\n",
    "Filter out the rounds you aren’t interested in.\n",
    "Calculate the total and average values for the rounds you are interested in.\n",
    "Normally, you can do this with a package like pandas, but you can also achieve this functionality with just a few generators"
